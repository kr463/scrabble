> 3 matrices made

It may seem like we have duplicate code for making the board matrices but since
the data structure used to make the board matrix is mutable, i.e. an array, we 
could not make independent copies of the same array. Hence, the 3 matrices 
created are each for 
1) the actual game play board, 
2) an empty matrix that represents the initial state of board (incl. 
   special scores) to be compared and used for game state changes,
3) a board matrix for the game tutorial.
